## 📍 Overview

This is an open-source project called ProtoconfLoader, a versatile system primarily devised for managing and optimizing web crawling processes across multiple devices and systems. It fosters unified communications over a custom protocol (ProtoConf) via Protobuf framework and gRPC messaging, centralizing configuration updates. Python 3 is exclusively used due to excellent compatibility with the required software modules.Key functionalities include the compilation of protobuf executables for synchronous communication between components, smart loading mechanism catering various configurations such as UserAgents, connection timeout adjustments and versatile logging practices, and dynamically updated demo applications illustrating this interaction. Unit test requirements support ensuring compatibility between Python 3.* and PyTest/pytest-asyncio alongside other specialized suites (GRPCIO).
